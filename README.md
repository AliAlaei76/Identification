# Identification
In this project, I have applied various identification methods, such as the Least Square method, Iterative methods, Recursive methods and so on, in order to identify the LTI dynamic model of a Synchronous Machine System through MATLAB
coding. I determined the best order of the derived models using Variance and Cost Function methods.
